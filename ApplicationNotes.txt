definition of substs and checks may possibly be handled using objects (?!)

define function to check for presence of replacing word in file and either
abort or ask if should abort
        ONCHECK ABORT|ASK|IGNORE ;global
        CHECK <txt>              ;local to file/go group
always process a check before a subst.

define word delimiters and seek for only a word and not
something in a word.

define filegroups and substgroups
